# Tvuetron
Vue, Bulma and Electron for video streaming reproduction

This is a playground project only used to exemplify some basic features about the Vue.js environment during the 2nd
talk in the VueDay celebrated in Alicante (Spain) on June, 2nd 2018

Given that some of the channels used then were not public the author decided to remove them from the channel.json file in /src/data
